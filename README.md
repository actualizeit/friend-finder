# Find that Special Someone With 

## Getting Started

This is pretty much for seeing how much it costs to buy a thing and keeping track of inventory. Avaialble "logins" are customer, manager and supervisor, which have different options, because we live in a society.

Open terminal within the file containing bamazonCustomer.js, bamazonManager.js, and bamazonSupervisor.js and use the "node" command and the name of the file i.e. ("bamazonCustomer.js") to run the file and be presented with an inquiring inquirer prompt.

### How it Works

You select options via inquirer and it updates the local mysql database, giving you cost information, updating stock and helping our corporate overlords make big picture decisions for us peons.

Take a look and be amazed!

### Prerequisites

This is a node app, so you'll need [node](https://nodejs.org/en/), obvi. You'll also need to install the other npm packages as discussed below.

### Installing

In addition to node, you'll need the packages and versions needed to run the application are contained in the package.json file. As was the way of the time. Just run "npm install" in the terminal window to install em all.

## Running the tests

Try stuff, go wild. Let me know what happens.
