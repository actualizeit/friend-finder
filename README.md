# Find that Special Someone With Friend Finder

## Getting Started

This app uses a proprietary matching formula to ensure that you are paired with only the most compatible guy named Ahmed that you are seeking. Just navigate to the app at Heroku to get the most recent deployment:

https://friend-finder-6.herokuapp.com/

### How it Works

By answering our battery of questions formulated by leading psychologists, you will provide us all the information needed to create a full model of you as a "person." Using this model, we then pair you with another "person" who is most attenuated to your unique, quantified "personhood." It's all quite complex I assure you.

### Prerequisites

The app is deployed using Heroku so there are no installations necessary, just an internet connection and modern web browser.

### Installing

See above, it will be elucidating.

## Running the tests

Try stuff, go wild. Let me know what happens.
